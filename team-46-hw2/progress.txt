We met and set up the environment for the coding part of this assignment. Then we walked through all the questions in this assignment and discussed on the solutions for those questions.
For Q1, we already had a draft for the part1 and part2 but we still need to refactor the pseudocode. For the rest Q2 and Q3, we had some ideas on how to solve the problem but they are not complete. So we decided to split the tasks, think on the solutions and we will sync up in our next collaration meeting.
