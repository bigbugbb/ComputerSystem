We met and discussed on what we are supposed to implement in this homework. After our initial discussion, we started understanding the cs5600fs implementation documentation in order to get a better picture about whatâ€™s going on around in the given file system.Since there is still one lecture left on the topic of file system, we figured that it might help us on the third question so we have only started working simultaneously on question 1 and 2. We will sync up later in this week to see our progress again.
